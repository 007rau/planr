---------------------------------------------------------
Planr is a simple and powerful planner app, designed to make managing daily tasks easier. Instead of the classic to-do list, Planr intelligently sorts your tasks into 'Today' and 'Tomorrow'. This keeps your to-do list managable and easy to use. When a day passes, all your tasks set for tomorrow are moved to today.

**Features:**
* Follows Google's Material Design, works on any screen size
* Add, remove, or delay tasks
* Stores your tasks locally on your device, without any accounts or managing passwords
* Provides the current weather (via Yahoo Weather) for today, and the forecast for tomorrow
* Export your tasks into plain text, HTML, CSV (viewable in Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheet programs), or Planr file types
* Import tasks from a Planr data file
